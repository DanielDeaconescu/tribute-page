                    Carlos Ruiz Zafón (25 September 1964 – 19 June 2020) was a Spanish novelist known for his 2001 novel
                    La
                    sombra del viento (The Shadow of the Wind).The novel sold 15 million copies and was winner of
                    numerous
                    awards. It was included in the list of the one hundred best books in Spanish in the last twenty-five
                    years, made in 2007 by eighty-one Latin American and Spanish writers and critics.

                    Ruiz Zafón was born in Barcelona. His grandparents had worked in a factory and his father sold
                    insurance. Ruiz Zafón began his working life in advertising. In the 1990s he moved to Los Angeles
                    where
                    he worked briefly in screen writing. He was fluent in English.

                    Influences on Ruiz Zafón's work have included 19th century classics, crime fiction,[11] noir
                    authors,
                    and contemporary writers.

                    Apart from books, another large influence came in the form of films and screenwriting. He said in
                    interviews that he found it easier to visualize scenes in his books in a cinematic way, which lends
                    itself to the lush worlds and curious characters he created.
